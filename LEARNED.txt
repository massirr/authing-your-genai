What I Learned - LangChain and Auth0 Development Session
========================================================

## Dependency Management Issues
- Encountered npm ERESOLVE dependency conflict between @langchain/core versions
- @langchain/core@0.3.48 was installed but langchain@0.3.31 required >=0.3.58
- Learned importance of keeping peer dependencies compatible
- Solution: Update @langchain/core to latest version (>=0.3.58)

## Git Configuration
- Discovered that Git requires user identity configuration before making commits
- Need to set both user.email and user.name globally or per repository
- Commands needed:
  - git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com"
  - git config --global user.name "Your Name"
- Without proper configuration, Git cannot auto-detect identity

## LangChain Tool Integration
- Successfully added Calculator tool from @langchain/community/tools/calculator
- Implemented tool calling in a React agent using createReactAgent
- Learned about LangGraph for building AI agent workflows
- Used ChatOpenAI with gpt-4o-mini model for the language model

## Development Environment
- Working in a dev container with Debian GNU/Linux 12
- Next.js application structure with TypeScript
- Auth0 integration for authentication
- Proper project structure with separated components, utils, and API routes

## Key Takeaways
- Always check dependency compatibility when adding new packages
- Proper Git configuration is essential for version control
- LangChain provides powerful tools for building AI agents
- Development containers provide consistent development environments
